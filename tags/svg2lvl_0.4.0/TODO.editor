* create a non-regression test using a special svg file which contains every type of data we're supposed to convert and the associated level file.

* do the lvl2svg convertor (in-progress).
* it seems that there is a bug with transformations when you got recursive layer -> spot it out.
* handle not only svg made by inkscape. (<=> handle the whole svg spec (inkscape only uses "path" and "rect", and 'M', 'L', 'C', 'A', 'z').
* if a user reports that svg2lvl is to slow for him, optimize it.
* create an installation script for unix
* show real textures and real sprites in inkscape (in-progress).
